#Sign language detection in realtime in localhost using FastAPi

So, this is like a 2nd version of my previous project on sign language. The same trained model weights are used in this project as well. 

Frameworks and tools used:
Ultralytics, YOLOv8, Python(3.9+), Javascript, HTML, CSS, FastAPI, OpenCV, Pytorch, Google colab.

Instructions to run the project:
1. Make sure you have installed all the requiremnets.txt libraries.
2. Now run the command "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080" OR just run the main.py file.
3. Open "localhost:8080" on your browser.
4. VOILÃ€!!!
